# under-the-sea

Under the sea is a project addressing the UN's 14th SDG: Life Below Water. It will be a standalone project away from QuestSDG, though it could be added.

The experience starts with the user standing in the sea. They can look around them to see plenty of various fish and the ocean environment. The user will be prompted to grab the fish, other creatures swimming by, and plants to learn about them; they will be shown their names and information. They will also be shown their endagerment status and what is causing harm to them, i.e. overfishing, pollution. There may be creatures that have gone extinct in the last few decades. After the user has explored their environment, the number of creatures reduces according to their specific endagerment status and the habitat becomes destroyed (coral reefs weakening). The sea is also filled with plastic to show the harm caused.

This project will not use passthrough as it aims to immerse the user in the ocean atmosphere. It will use hand detection so that the user may grab fish and do not need to use a controller to do this. Spatial audio will also be used to hear louder creatures swim past you and around you.
